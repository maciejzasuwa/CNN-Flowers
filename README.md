# CNN-Flowers
Convolutional Neural Network to recognize over 100 species of flowers

## Description of files:

cat_to_name.json - the list of the species that are recognized by the cnn

helper.py	- dependency needed for the main files

test_vgg16.py	- python code to test the cnn 

train_vgg16.py	- python code to train the cnn

## Additional resources of files:

Some more files (too big to upload them here) are needed. They can be downloaded here:

flower_data.zip - data used for training and testing

model_my_vgg16_epoch150_drop50_lr01.pt - trained network states
