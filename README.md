# CNN-Flowers
Convolutional Neural Network to recognize over 100 species of flowers. This project uses PyTorch library. VGG16 network was used.

## Description of files:

cat_to_name.json - the list of the species that are recognized by the cnn

helper.py	- import needed for the main files

test_vgg16.py	- python code to test the cnn 

train_vgg16.py	- python code to train the cnn

## Additional resources:

Some more files (too big to upload them here) are needed. They can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tCQxU_GlPrs2j-UYz59OeR5FNKwU5vBI

flower_data.zip - data used for training and testing

model_my_vgg16_epoch150_drop50_lr01.pt - trained network states
